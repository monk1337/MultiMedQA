In majority, it remains asymptomatic. Jaundice is rare and fever is uncommon.\nClinical course (HBV): Nearly 90\u201395% of patients clear the infection and have full recovery. 1% develop fulminant hepatitis resulting massive hepatic necrosis. 10-15% become chronic and 10% of these chronic cases suffer from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\nDiagnosis is confirmed by serological detection of HBsAg, HBeAg (denote high infectivity) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and HBV DNA titer (107\u20131011).\nScreening: All pregnant women should be screened for HBV infection at first antenatal visit and it should be repeated during the third trimester for \u2018high risk\u2019 groups (intravenous drug abusers, sexual promiscuity, hemophilics, patients on hemodialysis or having multiple sex partners).\nHepatitis C (HCV):\nIt is recognized as the major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide and is the leading cause of transfusion associated hepatitis. Transmission is mainly blood borne and to a lesser extent by faecal-oral route. It is responsible for chronic active hepatitis and hepatic failure.\nPerinatal transmission (10\u201340%) is high when coinfected with HIV and HBV.\nDetection is by antibody to HCV by EIA, which develops usually late in the infection.\nConfirmation is done by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-3).\nChronic carrier state is present. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated.\nHepatitis D (HDV):\nIt is seen in patients infected with HBV either as a co-infection or super infection. Perinatal transmission is known.\nHepatitis E (HEV): Hepatitis E is the most important cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis in developing countries like India. Chronic carrier state is present. Perinatal transmission is uncommon.\nMaternal mortality is very high (15\u201320%).",

Inhibition of choline esterase results In increased amount of Ach at synapse, so poisoning or overdose results in cholinergic symptoms like salivation, lacrimation, urination, emesis, increased bronchial secretions, reduction in blood pressure.So treatment Of choice is Atropine. Atropine -It is highly effective in counter-acting the muscarinic symptoms, but higher doses are required to antagonize the central effects. It does not reverse peripheral muscular paralysis which is a nicotinic action. All cases of anti-ChE (carbamate or organophosphate) poisoning must be promptly given atropine2 mg i.v. repeated every 10 min till dryness of mouth or other signs of atropinization appear (upto 200 mg has been administered in a day). Continued treatment with maintenance doses may be required for 1-2 weeks. Neostigmine and physostigmine worsens the signs and symptoms as these also act by inhibiting choline esterase. Physostigmine and flumazenil are respectively used for Atropine and benzodiazepines poisoning.",

It is not detectable in the serum during convalescent stage. The presence of HBsAg alone does not necessarily indicate the replication of complete virion, and the patients may not have symptoms of liver damage.\u00a0\n\nParija SC.

The additive e\ufb00ect of tangential tensile stress induced in the porcelain by the intraoral force can exceed the tensile strength\u00a0of the porcelain and causes crack propagation in the porcelain veneer. When the contraction coe\ufb03cient of the porcelain is much lower than that of the metal (\u03b1P much lower than \u03b1M), porcelain cracking or metal-ceramic bond failure can occur near the metal-porcelain interface. This incompatibility failure is likely caused by the development of radial tensile stresses that exceed the tensile strength of porcelain.\nContraction coe\ufb03cient of the porcelain - \u03b1P\u00a0\u00a0\nContraction coe\ufb03cient of the metal - \u03b1M\n\u00a0\nPhillip\u2019s 12th edition page 423",

B: Normal HbF and normal HbA2Alpha (0) thalassemia -Individuals with this disorder are not able to produce any functional alpha-globin and thus are unable to make any functional hemoglobin A, F, or A2. This leads to the development of hydrops fetalis, also known as hemoglobin Ba, a condition that is incompatible with extra uterine life.Alpha (+) thalassemia - genetic mutations that result in decreased production of alpha-globin usually due to the functional deletion of 1 of the 4 alpha globin genes. Based on the number of inherited alpha genes, it is subclassified into 3 general forms:Thalassemia (-u/ a a) is characterized by inheritance of 3 normal a-genes. These patients are referred to clinically as silent carrier of alpha thalassemia. Other names for this condition are alpha thalassemia minima, alpha thalassemia-2 trait, and heterozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia minor. The affected individuals exhibit no abnormality clinically and may be hematologically normal or have mild reductions in red cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of 2 normal alpha genes due to either heterozygosity for alpha (0) thalassemia (u a/ --) or homozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia (-u/-a) results in the development of alpha thalassemia minor or alpha thalassemia-1 trait. The affected individuals are clinically normal but frequently have minimal anemia and reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of one normal alpha gene (-a/ --) results in abundant formation of hemoglobin H. This condition is known as ElbH disease. The affected individuals have moderate to severe lifelong hemolytic anemia, modest degrees of ineffective erythropoiesis, splenomegaly and variable bony changesPersons with alpha-thalassemia traits have normal HbA2 and HbF levels whereas beta- thalassemia patients have elevated HbA2",

Approximately 70%of individuals with hyper lgM syndrome have the X linked form of the disease , caused by mutations in the gene coding CD40L located on Xq26. In remaining patients,the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Most of these patients have loss of function mutation involving either CD40 or enzyme called AID. So, B-cells can be detected by flowcytometryhaving low expression of CD40. Bruton's disease -In this disease, there is defect in B-cell tyrosine kinase enzyme. This leads to hypogammaglobulinemia. Bare lymphocyte syndrome- In this disorder, There is defect in MHC-2 molecule which is required for CD4 T-cell formation. SCID - This is both X-linked and autosomal recessive disorder.",

There is usually marked congestion, cyanosis, and petechiae in the face and neck.This occurs when the individual acquires a ceain body position in which breathing is impaired, often because of neck twisting with kinking or compression of trachea and/or elevation of the tongue into the posterior hypopharynx. Normal venous return to the hea may be impaired.The body is typically inveed (upside-down) & weight of abdominal contents press against the diaphragm pushing it upwards, thus compressing the thoracic organs, which combined with decreased respiratory movements, leads to cardiorespiratory failure & death.It is always accidental",

At moderate levels of constriction, It increases glomerular hydrostatic pressure resulting in increasing GFR If efferent aeriolar constriction is severe; It decreases renal blood flow; filtration fraction & glomerular colloid osmotic pressure increases as efferent aeriolar resistance increases resulting in colloid osmotic pressure exceeds increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure resulting in decrease in GFR. Blood from efferent aerioles enter peritubular capillaries, so if efferent aeriole is constricted, less blood enters peritubular capillaries, which results in increase in oncotic pressure in peri tubular capillaries.",

PCRReverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (-PCR) It is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA (in this context called complementary DNA or cDNA) and amplification of specific DNA targets using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).It is primarily used to measure the amount of a specific RNA. This is achieved by monitoring the amplification reaction using fluorescence, a technique called real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (qPCR). Combined -PCR and qPCR are routinely used for the analysis of gene expression and quantification of viral RNA in research and clinical settings.A method used to quantitate mRNA levels that rely upon the first step of cDNA copying of mRNAs catalyzed by reverse transcriptase before PCR amplification and quantitation. Sanger sequencing,Also known as the chain termination method, is a technique for DNA sequencing-based upon the selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) by DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA replication.Next-generation sequencing:Modified methods of genome sequencing. It has significantly reduced the cost and time taken for whole-genome sequencing.It is a technique similar to Sanger sequencing, done on DNA",

(B) 5An odds ratio (OR) is a statistic that quantifies the strength of the association between two events, A and B.Two events are independent if and only if the OR equals 1: the odds of one event are the same in either the presence or absence of the other event.If the OR is greater than 1, then A and B are associated (correlated) in the sense that, compared to the absence of B, the presence of B raises the odds of A, and symmetrically the presence of A raises the odds of B.Conversely, if the OR is less than 1, then A and B are negatively correlated, and the presence of one event reduces the odds of the other event.Most Impoantly Odds ratio does not demonstrate causality .But we can say that they are positively correlated.

The second Mass Spectrometer is used to separate the fragment ions according to mass resulting in \"MS/MS\" or MS2 spectrum. Advantage is that large number of samples can be dealt with in a sho time.. *HPLC is used as a confirmatory test of the primary test by TMS.

            "Correct Option": "B",
            "Explanation": "livpolastic left heart syndrome \n\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome occurs when parts of the left side of the heart (mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, and aorta) do not develop completely. The condition is present at birth (congenital).\nHypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. About 10 % of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.\nThe problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the:\n\n(i) Aorta-the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body\nEntrace and exit of the ventricle\nMitral and aortic valves\n\nThis causes the left ventricle and aorta to be poorly developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.\nIn patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for awhile, but this extra workoad eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.\nThe only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and left side of the heart, or between the systemic\n\narteries and pumonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blodd to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two\nof these connections:\n(i) Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium)\nDuctus arteriosus (a small vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)\n\nBoth of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.\nIn babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood from the right side of the heart travels through the ductus arteriosus. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. if the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the patient may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body.\nBabies with known hypoplatic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosusopen.\nBecause there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood reaming to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Patients with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).\n\nSymptoms\n\nAt first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may apper normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include:\n\n\nBluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color\nCold hands and feed (extremities)\n\n\nLethargy\n\n\nPoor pulse\nPoor suckling and feeding\nPounding heart\nRapid breathing\nShortness of breath.\nSince the systemic circulation is dependent on the patent ductus arteriosus the closure of ductus arterious leads to shock.\nSigns of heart failure usually appears within the first few days or weeks of life and include dyspnoea, hepatomegaly and low cardiac output. When PDA closes suddenly shock occurs all the peripheral pulses may be weak or absent.\n\nVentricular septal defect\n\nThese patients with VSD's become symptomatic around 6-10 weeks of age.\nThey usually present with congestive cardiac failure.\n\nEbstein's anomaly \n\nEbstein's anomaly consists of downward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid value into the right ventricle.\nThese patients usually present in teenage/adolescent years.\nThey may also present in infancy but they usually do not present with shock or severe hypoperfusion.\n\nAorticopulmonary window defect\n\nAn Aorticopulmanry window defect consists of a communication between the ascending Aorta and the main pulmonary artery.\nIn these cases minimal cyanosis is present and they may present with heart failure in infancy.",

Many acquired and congenital cardiac lesions are vulnerable, particularly areas of endocardial damage caused by a high-pressure jet of blood, such as ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation, many of which are haemodynamically insigni\ufb01cant. In contrast, the risk of endocarditis at the site of haemodynamically important low-pressure lesions, such as a large atrial septal defect, is minimal.\nReference: : Davidson 23rd ed page no 527",

In liver, these fatty acids are broken down by beta-oxidation of fatty acids to give Acetyl CoA. This excess acetyl CoA obtained from fatty acids breakdown is used for the formation of fats e.g. fatty acids, endogenous TGs, VLDL & cholesterol. This is the only anabolic thing occurring in the liver of diabetic patients. Options A & B - wrong as the body is mainly in catabolism, not anabolism.

Hence, a correction factor of 10% is required, i.e., add 10% to the figure obtained above.Total number of Expected Pregnancies Z = Y + 10% of YPopulation under the subcentre = 5000Bih rate = 20Expected no. of live-bihs (Y)/year = 20 x 5000/1000 = 100Total number of Expected Pregnancies Z = Y + 10% of Y =100 + 10% of 100 = 110Expected number of ANC registrations will be half of yearly calculation = 55",

Decrease in hea rate on adrenaline administration after phentolamine has been given (Ref: KDT 7/e e p131, 140).This was first demonstrated by Sir HH Dale (1913) and is called vasomotor reversal of Dale.Blockade of vasoconstrictor alpha-1 (also alpha-2) receptors reduces peripheral resistance and causes pooling of blood in capacitance vessels a venous return and cardiac output are reduced a Fall in BP.Postural reflex is interfered with a marked hypotension occurs on standing a dizziness and syncope. Hypovolemia accentuates the hypotension.Decrease in hea rate on adrenaline administration after phentolamine has been given depicts vasomotor reversal of Dale.The alpha-blocker abolishes the pressor action of adrenaline (injected IV in animals), which then produces only fall in BP due to beta-2 mediated vasodilatation.",

Low-energy photons\u00a0that cannot reach the receptor contribute to patient risk but do no offer any benefit. Consequently, it is desirable to remove these low-energy photons from the beam. This removal can be accomplished in part by placing a metallic disk (filter) in the beam path.\u00a0\nA filter preferentially removes low-energy photons from the beam, while allowing high energy photons that are able to contribute to making an image to pass through.\u00a0\nRef: Oral Radiology, Principles and Interpretation / Stuart C.

The major effect of coicosteroids is to switch off the transcription of multiple activated genes that encode inflammatory proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory enzymes. This effect involves several mechanisms, including inhibition of the transcription factor NF-KB, but an impoant mechanism is recruitment of HDAC2 to the inflammatory gene complex, which reverses the histone acetylation associated with increased gene transcription. Coicosteroids also activate anti-inflammatory genes, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1, and increase the expression of IQ-receptors. Most of the metabolic and endocrine side effects of coicosteroids are also mediated through transcriptional activation.",

If father is also NESTROFT positive, confirmatory test for HbA2 is done for father.\nIf both the parents have thalessemia trait, there is 1:4 chance of fetus having thalassemia major.\nTherefore, prenatal diagnosis is done by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in first trimester.\nIf CVS confirms the fetus to be having thalasemia major, termination of pregnancy is indicated after counseling the parents.\nIf the fetus has thalassemia minor (trait) pregnancy is continued as such and baby will have normal lifespan.\nIt is worth noting here that a positive NESTROFT test is seen in other conditions beside beta thalassemia trait. These are iron deficiency anemia, alpha thalassemia trait, homozygous and heterozygous HbE, HbS as well as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin.\n\nTherefore, a positive NESTROFT test should always be followed by a confirmatory test for HBA2 ( eg. serum electrophoresis).",

Lack of myelin inhibiting substance(Ref GanonGr 90; Clinical Box 4-)Following CNS injuries several events which provide inappropriate environment for regeneration are: (Ganong 23/e p90) Astrocytic proliferation)Activation of microgliaScar formationInflammationInvasion of immune cellsCNS neurons do not have the growth promoting chemical needed for the regenerationCNS myelin is a potent inhibitor of axonal growthAxon Regeneration in CNSThe proximal stump of a damaged axon in the CNS will form sho sprouts, but distant stump recovery is rare, and the damaged axons are unlikely to form new synapses. This is because:CNS neurons do not have the growth promoting chemical needed for the regenerationCNS myelin is a potent inhibitor of axonal growth.That is why treatment of brain and spinal cord injuries frequently focuses on rehabilitation rather than reversing the nerve damage. Following CNS injuries, several events which provide inappropriate environment for regeneration are:Astrocytic proliferationActivation of microgliaformationInflammationInvasion of immune cellsNew research is aiming to identify ways to initiate and maintain axonal growth, to direct regenerating axons to reconnect with their target neurons and to reconstitute original neuronal circuit.",

D/D Atrial fibrillation Multifocal atrial tachycardia P wave absent P wave present Variable RR interval Therefore ruled out P wave varying amplitual and answer is MAT. Trick to solve: First check if patient has tachycardia/bradycardia RR interval Narrow QRS suggests supraventricular tachycardia COPD is the reason for multifocal atrial tachycardia due to right ventricular strain causing RV enlargement causing right axis duration. Visible P wave variable amplitude RR interval changing Narrow QRS All point towards diagnosis of multifocal atrial tachycardia. Monomorphic VT is ruled out as it has broad QRS complex.

Most of the cases follow trauma.it can be accidental or surgical. Inflammation, mucoceles of sinuses, sinunasal polyposis, fungal infection of sinuses & osteomyelitis, can all erode the bone and dura. Neoplasms, idiopathic- where cause is unknown and patient has spontaneous leak. SITE OF Leakage- CSF from anterior cranial fossa reaches the nose (1) cribriform plate, (2) roof of ethmoid air cells or (3) frontal sinus. CSF from middle cranial fossa follows injuries to sphenoid sinus, cribriform plate. In fracture of temporal bone, CSF reaches the middle ear and then escapes through the Eustachian tube into the nose (CSF OTORHINORRHOEA) DIAGNOSIS- there is history of clear watery discharge from the nose on bending the head or straining. CSF rhinorrhea should be differentiated from nasal discharge as the former is sudden, gushes in drops when bending and cannot be sniffed back. CSF rhinorrhea after head trauma is mixed with blood and shows \"target sign\" when collected on filter paper.it shows central red spot and peripheral lighter halo sign. LAB TEST = BETA-2 transferrin is seen in CSF and not in the nasal discharge. its presence is a specific and sensitive test.",

Secondary markings- They are produced on the surface of the bullet by imperfection on the inner surface of the barrel. These irregularities are produced by sticking of paicles of the bullet to the bore when shots are fired and is known as metallic fouling. They also result accidentally during the manufacturing process, usually microscopic in nature and have random distribution. They are useful in identifying the specific gun which was fired.",

Fast films are desirable from the standpoint of exposure reduction. Multiple studies have found that E/F-speed film is preferred, because it has the same useful density range, latitude, contrast, and image quality as D-speed films and can be used in routine intraoral radiographic examinations without sacrifice of diagnostic information.\u00a0\nCurrent digital sensors offer equal or greater dose savings than E/F-speed film and comparable diagnostic utility.\nReference: White and Pharoah's Oral Radiology Principles and Interpretation 7th edition page no 33",

The 2 most common symptoms are usually fever and flank pain. E. coli is the most common bacteria causing acute pyelonephritis due to its unique ability to adhere to and colonize the urinary tract and kidneys.Histopathology will usually reveal necrosis or putrid abscess formation within the renal parenchyma. The renal tissues are infiltrated with neutrophils, macrophages and plasma cells. However, architecture is not completely disorganized.The presence of white blood cells within or upon casts strongly suggests pyelonephritis, direct infection of the kidney. They may also be seen in inflammatory states, such as acute allergic interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, or post-streptococcal acute glomerulonephritis.",

These strains are (1, 3, 5, 6, 18).\nThe M proteins molecules has a particular surface exposed antigenic domain against which Rheumatic fever patients mount a strong antibody response.

The hypothalamus contains two types of magnocellular (large) neurons that synthesize ADH in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, about five sixths in the supraoptic nuclei and about one sixth in the paraventricular nuclei. Both of these nuclei have axonal extensions to the posterior pituitary.\nThe\u00a0most\u00a0important\u00a0renal\u00a0action\u00a0of\u00a0ADH\u00a0is\u00a0to\u00a0increase\u00a0the\u00a0water permeability\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 distal\u00a0 tubule,\u00a0 collecting\u00a0 tubule,\u00a0and collecting\u00a0duct\u00a0epithelia. This effect helps the body to conserve water in circumstances such as dehydration. In the absence of ADH, the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water is low, causing the kidneys to excrete large amounts of dilute urine, a condition called diabetes insipidus. Thus, the actions of ADH play a key role in controlling the degree of dilution or concentration of the urine.",

The cast-metal onlay is often an excellent alternative to a crown for teeth that have been greatly weakened by caries or by large, failing restorations but where the facial and lingual tooth surfaces are relatively unaffected by disease or injury. For such weakened teeth, the superior physical properties of a casting alloy are desirable to withstand the occlusal loads placed on the restoration; also the onlay can be designed to distribute occlusal loads over the tooth in a manner that decreases the chance of tooth fracture in the future.\nSturdevant operative dentistry\u00a07th\u00a0Edition, Page No:e94",

With time pulmonary vascular resistance increases due to change in pulmonary vessel wall as a result of increased flow in pulmonary vessels. When pulmonary vascular pressure exceeds the systemic vascular resistance, reversal of shunt into right to left shunt occurs.\nThis development of right to left shunt due to reversal of left to right shunt as a result of development of pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary hypertension is called Eisenmenger syndrome.",

Reason for this restriction is that sholy after action potential is initiated, the sodium channels (or calcium channels / both) become inactivated & no amount of excitatory signal applied to these channels at this point will open inactivated gates. Only condition that will allow them to reopen is when membrane potential returns to or gets close to original resting membrane potential level. Then, within another small fraction of second, inactivated gates of channels open & new action potential can be initiated This period for large myelinated nerve fibers is about 1/2500 second thus, such fibers can transmit maximum of about 2500 impulses per second - Na have 2 gates, activated gate & an inactivated gate. At resting state - active gate - closed - inactive gate - open At stimulus - both gates are open At absolute refractory period - active gate - open; inactive gate - closed Next action potential is generated only after inactivated gate is open & both gates go back to resting state.",

This results in abolition of negative feedback on TSH secretion. Thus, there is elevated TSH and pituitary can become hyperplastic to produce more TSH.\nIn pituitary cause of hypothyroidism (secondary hypothyroidism) both TSH and Thyroid hormone (T4, T3) are low as pituitary does not secrete TSH and TSH is the major stimulation for production of T4 and T3.\n\nAbout option d\n\nTSH resistance can also produce same picture i.e. raised TSH and low T4 with pituitary swelling.\nThere is thyroid insensitivity to TSH which results in hypothyroidism (1T4 and T3). Because of reduced thyroid hormone feedback, TSH is markedly elevated.\nHowever, Amongst the given options best option is primary hypothyrodism because TSH resistance is a very rare condition and further T4 levels are normal in Mild and moderate (Partial) TSH resistance.",

Not more than 10% of the people benefitted by the drug could he due to chanceThe p (probability) value is used when we wish to see how likely is that a hypothesis is true, The hypothesis is usually that there is no difference between two treatments, known as \"null hypothesis'.The p value gives the probability of any observed difference having happened by chance.p:0.5 means that the probability of any observed difference having happened by chance is 0.5 in I or 50:50.Similarly, a p valae of <0.10 means that the probubility of it happening by chance is 10%.In the question, the probability that the drug affected the chronic hypeensives by chance is less than 1096.

            "Explanation": "Well friends, we have discussed the causes and investigations of DIC. Now here let\u2019s take a look at its management.\\\nManagement of DIC\n\nThe most important step is to terminate the pregnancy- vaginal delivery without episiotomy is preferred to cesarean section\nVolume replacement by crystalloids or colloids will reduce the amount of whole blood needed to restore the blood volume.\n500 ml of fresh blood raises the fibrinogen level approximately by 12.5 mg/100 ml and platelets by 10,000\u201315,000 cu mm. Fresh blood- helps in flushing out fibrin degradation product and improving the micro circulation.\nTo replace fibrinogen- Fresh frozen plasma should be given: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is extracted from whole blood. It contains fibrinogen, anti-thrombin III, clotting factors V, XI, XII. FFP transfusion provides both volume replacement and coagulation factors. One unit of FFP (250 mL) raises the fibrinogen by 5-10 mg/dL. FFP does not need to be ABO or Rh compatible.\nCryoprecipitate is obtained from thawed FFP. It is rich in fibrinogen, factor VIII, Von Willebrand\u2019s factor, and XIII. Cryoprecipitate provides less volume (40 mL) compared to FFP (250 mL). So it should not be used for volume replacement. One unit of cryoprecipitate increases the fibrinogen level by 5-10 mg/dL.\nIn case of active bleeding with platelet counts < 50,000/ml or prophylactically with platelet count 20\u201330,000/ml \u2013 platelet replacement should be done. Platelet should ABO and Rh specific. 1 units (50 ml) raises the platelet count by 7500/ ml\nRecombinant activated factors VIIA: (60-100 \u03bcg/kg IV) can reverse DIC within 10 minute as it is a precusor for extrinsic clotting cascade which is replaced.\nRole of Heparin\n\nAccording to Williams Obs. \u201cHeparin is not used in DIC.\u201d\nAccording to COGDT 10/e, p 999\n\u201cHeparin acts as an anticoagulant by activating antithrombin III but has little effect on activated coagulation factors. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in patients with fulminant DIC and central nervous system insults, fulminant liver failure, or obstetric accidents. The one instance, however, in which heparin has been demonstrated to benefit pregnancy-related DIC is in the case of the retained dead fetus with intact vascular system, where heparin may be administered to interrupt the coagulation process and thrombocytopenia for several days until delivery may be implemented.\u201d\nAs far as EACA is concerned- Williams Obs. 22/e, p 844 says \u2013\n\u201cEACA is not recommended in case of DIC.\u201d\nAccording to Williams Obs 23/e, p 787\n\u201cIt use in most types of obstetric coagulopathy has not been efficacious & not recommended\u201d",

            "Correct Option": "C",
            "Explanation": "Since alginate is a viscoelastic material, its tear strength is increased when the impression is removed along a vertical\u00a0path with a snap. The speed of removal must be a compromise between\u00a0a\u00a0 rapid\u00a0movement\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0slower\u00a0rate\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0more comfortable for the patient. Usually an\u00a0alginate impression does not adhere to the oral tissues as well as some of the elastomers do, so it is easier to remove the alginate impression rapidly. However, it is always best to avoid torquing or twisting the impression in an effort to remove it quickly. Specifically, the handle should be used minimally during breaking of the air seal (\u201csuction\u201d) or removal of the tray from the teeth.\nPhillips dental materials 12th edition page no 174",

Mother starts producing and transferring antibodies approximately 5 days after the onset of her disease.Thus, babies born 5 days or more from the beginning of maternal disease will be protected.\n\nFernando Arias 3/e, p 156\n\nPerinatal varicella exposure just before or during delivery poses a serious threat to newborns and so Varicella Ig should be given to all neonates of born to mothers who have clinical evidence of varicella 5 days before and upto 2 days after delivery.\nThe use of VZIG decreases the chances of neonatal varicella and also modify the clinical course but it does not always prevent severe or fatal varicella. Expectant treatment with close observation, followed by prompt initiation of antiviral therapy on suspicion of neonatal varicella is recommended.\nAntiviral treatment (acyclovir) is given to neonates only if they develop neonatal varicella syndrome.\nVaccine is not secreted in breast milk, so postpartum vaccination should not be delayed because of breast feeding.",

These results confirm the observation that East Asian populations have more three-rooted mandibular first molars than do other racial groups. Mandibular molars, mainly first molars, may also have an additional root located lingually or buccally. Although this is a rare occurrence in Caucasian populations, it is more common\u00a0in Asian populations. The radix entomolaris (RE) is a supernumerary root located distolingually\u00a0in\u00a0mandibular molars, whereas the radix paramolaris (RP) is an extra root located mesiobuccally. Each root usually contains a single root canal.

Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload.

            "Correct Option": "B",
            "Explanation": "- Metronidazole is drug of choice for bacterial vaginosis ( with or without pregnancy )- Alternative to metronidazole is clindamycin.- Rovamycin i.e. spiramycin (which is a macrolide) is drug of choice for toxoplasmosis in pregnancy. Metronidazole -* It is the prototype nitroimidazole having broad-spectrum cidal activity against anaerobic protozoa, including Giardia lamblia , trichomonas and amoeba. * Many anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria, such as Bact. fragilis, Fusobacterium, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter, peptococci, spirochetes and anaerobic Streptococci are sensitive. * Metronidazole does not affect aerobic bacteria. Mechanism of action- After entering the cell by diffusion, its nitro group is reduced by ceain redox proteins operative only in anaerobic microbes to a highly reactive nitro radical which exes cytotoxicity. The nitro radical of metronidazole acts as an electron sink which competes with the biological electron acceptors of the anaerobic organism for the electrons generated by the pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme pathway of pyruvate oxidation. The energy metabolism of anaerobes that have no mitochondria is thus, disrupted. Aerobic environment attenuates cytotoxicity of metronidazole by inhibiting its reductive activation. Moreover, O2 competes with the nitro radical of metronidazole for the free electrons generated during energy metabolism of anaerobes. Metronidazole, in addition, has been found to inhibit cell mediated immunity, to induce mutagenesis and to cause radiosensitization. Uses of metronidazole- o Amoebiasiso Giardiasiso Trichomonas vaginitiso Bacterial vaginosiso Anaerobic bacterial infection o Pseudomembranous enterocolitiso Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitiso Helicobacter pylori gastritis o Guinea worm infestation",

Passive diffusion of molecules along the concentration gradient.Fick's law of diffusion: The magnitude of the diffusing tendency is directly propoional to the cross-sectional area across which diffusion is taking place and the concentration gradient or chemical gradient, which is the difference in the concentration of the diffusing substance divided by the thickness of the membrane. The time required for equilibrium by diffusion is propoional to the square of diffusion distance.Diffusion is the process by which a gas or substance in solution expands, because of the motion of its paicles, to fill all of the available volumes.",

C: Nitrous oxideGeneral anaesthesia can be induced by intravenous (IV) injection, or breathing a volatile anaesthetic through a facemask (inhalational induction).Onset of anaesthesia is faster with IV injection than with inhalation, taking about 10-20 seconds to induce total unconsciousness.This has the advantage of avoiding the excitatory phase of anaesthesia, and thus reduces complications related to induction of anaesthesia.An inhalational induction may be chosen by the anesthesiologist where IV access is difficult to obtain, where difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or due to patient preference (e.g. children).Commonly used IV induction agents include propofol, sodium thiopental, etomidate, and ketamine.The most commonly-used agent for inhalational induction is sevoflurane because it causes less irritation than other inhaled gasesIn order to prolong anaesthesia for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained. Usually this is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen, nitrous oxide, and a volatile anaesthetic agent or by having a carefully controlled infusion of medication, usually propofol, through an IV.Induction Characteristics & Dosage Requirements for Currently AvailableSedative & Hypnotic DrugsDrug NameInduction Dose (mg/kg)Onset (sec)Duration (min)Thiopental3-6<305-10Methohexital1-3<305-10Propofol1.5-2.515-455-10Midazolam0.2-0,430-9010-30Diazepam0.3-0.645-9015-30Lorazepam0.03-0.0660-12060-120Etomidate0.2-0.33-123-12Ketamine1-210-2010-20",

However, even low-dose pills pose significant risk in women > 35 years of age, diabetics, hypertensives and in those who smoke. The excess risk is due to the estrogen component of the OC, and normalizes shortly after stopping the OC.\nRise in BP: Occurred in 5-10% women taking the earlier pills. The again is less frequent and smaller in magnitude with the low-dose pills of today. If the BP rises, best is to stop OCs: the BP normalizes in the next 3-6 months. Both the estrogen and progestin components are responsible for this effect, probably by increasing plasma angiotensinogen level and renin activity which have been found to be raised during OC use. Aldosterone secretion is enhanced resulting in salt and water retention.\n\nReference: Essentials of Medical Pharmacology Eighth Edition KD\u00a0TRIPATHI\u00a0page no 351",

            "Explanation": "Timing of SABG surgery:\nSecondary alveolar bone grafting (SABG) is done at an age when the growth inhibition effects of the surgery on maxilla are minimised, and it can help the maxillary canine or lateral incisor to erupt normally through the cancellous bone. After the age of 9 years, maxillary growth is minimal. Secondary bone grafting is done during the mixed dentition stage after the eruption of permanent incisors, but before the eruption of permanent canines. The timing of bone graft is based on the root formation and eruption pattern of the maxillary lateral incisor and maxillary canine. In case, insufficient bone is available in the cleft area for the lateral incisors to erupt, bone graft can be done around 7 years of age.\nNote:\u00a0In this patient, since the transverse width is normal, there is no need for expansion.\nOrthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities 3rd ed Om P.

Beta blockers used are - Carvedilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol. Sacubitril - It is NEP(neutral endopeptidase) inhibitor, which is required for metabolism of BNP(brain natriuretic peptide) as a result BNP levels are increased resulting in natriuresis and vasodilation. Thus can be used in CHF. Nesiritide- It is recombinant BNP. It is given through subcutaneous route. Trimetazidine -it is a metabolic modulator. it paially inhibits beta oxidation of fatty acids which results in shifting of metabolism of hea muscles from fatty acids to glucose Which require less amount of oxygen so beneficial for the patient of angina pectoris but not used in hea failure.",

It is therefore, believed to be free of cardiovascular risk. No Q-T prolongation has been noted during clinical trial.* Side effects are headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain and diarrhoea; but generally subside during use.",

If we break disulphide bond in a protein this will lead to denaturation of the protein. B Chain has total 30 amino acid.7th and 19th are cysteine So they also cannot be changed, or if changed will lead to denaturation of the protein Thus options C and D can be ruled out. Interchange of A1 & A4, i.e. glycine and glutamate, which can also be ruled out because glycine is an amino acid which is conserved during evolution in most of the proteins. Interchange of B29 and B30: - The insulin which is used in the treatment - Insulin lispro actually has a change in the carboxy terminal of B chain.

Here BP is 150/100, (Therefore, it is not necessary to start antihypertensive). The NICE clinical guidelines suggest treating moderate hypertension (BP-150/100-159/109 mm Hg) with antihypertensives to keep B I P <150/80-100 range. The benefits or disadvantages of this intervention have not been elucidated by adequate clinical trials.\nFernando Arias 4/e, p 209.\n\u201cThere is a consensus that if BP is below 150/100 mm Hg, there is no need for antihypertensive therapy. An exception may be if mild hypertension is associated with markers of potential severe disease or sign of organ dysfunction, (heavy proteinuria, liver dysfunction, hematological dysfuntion)\u201d.\nFernando Arias 4/e, p 209.\nThus, in this patient, the role of antihypertensive is not confirmatory as BP is 150/100 mm Hg. But role of induction of labor is confirmed, as patient is 37 weeks pregnant with mild hypertension.\nPIH is not a contraindication for VBAC (Vaginal birth after cesarean) and further more that the pelvis of this patient is adequate \u2013 so there is no harm in inducing labour, rather it is advantageous, because it will help in developing lower uterine segment. At any point of time; if there is scar tenderness or if patients BP rises immediately perform cesarean section\u2019 therefore the best answer here is \u2013 Antihypertensive regime and then induce labour",

Poor Preoperative preparation of the patientThis is a rare but life-threatening complication of thyrotoxicosis.The most prominent signs are fever, agitation, delirium, tachycardia or atrial fibrillation and, in the older patient, cardiac failure. Thyrotoxic crisis is a medical emergency and has a moality of 10% despite early recognition and treatment.It is most commonly precipitated by an infection in a patient with previously unrecognized or inadequately treated thyrotoxicosis.It may also develop in known thyrotoxicosis sholy after thyroidectomy in an ill-prepared patient or within a few days of 131I therapy, when acute radiation damage may lead to a transient rise in serum thyroid hormone levels.Patients should be rehydrated and given propranolol, either orally (80 mg 4 times daily) or intravenously (1-5 mg 4 times daily). Sodium iodate (500 mg per day orally) will restore serum T3 levels to normal in 48-72 hours.This is a radiographic contrast medium that not only inhibits the release of thyroid hormones but also reduces the conversion of T4 to T3 and is, therefore, more effective than potassium iodide or Lugol's solution.",

They are often formulated in several consistencies, including extra low, low, medium, heavy, and putty, in increasing order of filler content. Extra-low and putty forms are available only for condensation and addition silicones.\nPolysulfide is provided only in light-body and heavy-body consistencies. There is no heavy-body product for condensation silicone. Pigments are added to give each material a distinct color.\nThe base paste, is a polysulfide polymer that contains a multifunctional mercaptan (-SH) called a polysulfide polymer, a suitable\u00a0 filler\u00a0 (such as lithopone or titanium dioxide) to provide the required strength, a plasticizer (such as dibutyl phthalate) to confer the appropriate viscosity to the paste, and a small quantity of sulfur, approximately 0.5%, as an accelerator.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 153",

The methods adopted are compression of Aorta (knee chest position) and use of vasopressor drugs like methoxamine (Phenylepinephrine is also a vasopressor).\nAny condition or drug which causes peripheral pooling of blood should be avoided because this will reduce return of blood to heart.\nTherefore isoprenaline which has marked 13, agonistic action should be avoided as it will cause vasodilatation which leads to peripheral pooling of blood.

            "Explanation": "Aim for the treatment of classical angina is decrease in work of hea. It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload. However, in variant angina these drugs benefit by causing coronary vasodilation as variant angina occurs due to vasospasm of coronary aery.",

            "Correct Option": "C",
            "Explanation": "1. The reason for the development of allergy is the presence of plasma and the process of washing helps in the removal of residual plasma. if the Patient is having a history of allergy - Antihistaminic drugs -reduce the chances of development of allergic reactions during blood transfusion. 2. Irradiation - reduces the chance of development of Graft Versus Host Disease. Irradiation - causes - reduction in the number of the immunocompetent cells (lymphocytes mainly) Irradiation of cellular blood components (red blood cells, platelets, and granulocytes) is indicated to prevent the development of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Patients at risk of TA-GVHD include immunocompromised patients who are receiving a bone marrow or stem cell transplant and fetuses undergoing an intrauterine transfusion. Irradiation is also indicated for recipients of components collected from a blood relative or HLA-matched donors. 3. Leukocyte reduction - Leukoreduction of whole blood and blood components has been shown to reduce recurrent febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, reduce alloimmunization to leukocyte antigens that may complicate care of patients whoundergo transplantation or chronic transfusion therapy, and protect against transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) to patients at increased risk of CMV disease. antibodies in the recipient - react with donor leukocytes - release of cytokines - cause fever- known as Febrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction. 4. Glycolisation - addition of glycol. useful in autologous blood transfusion - increases the life span of RBC. If the patient is having a history of development of anaphylaxis after blood transfusion, the patient is most likely to be suffering from IgA deficiency.",

This fetal hemoglobin disappears after 5 month of age so that by 5 months of age, the sickling of the red blood cells is prominent and symptoms begin.\nPNH is manfested in adults.\nSo, both PNH and sickle cell anemia does not cause jaundice since birth.\nBut among these two I would prefer PNH as the answer because it is manifested in adulthood while the patient in question is a 5-years old child.\nSickle cell anemia symptoms develop at the age of 5 months and it is one of the cause of jaundice",

However, there is little or no correlation for orthodontic wires between the coefficients of friction and surface roughness. (i.e., interlocking and plowing are not significant components of the total frictional resistance).\u00a0\nAlthough NiTi has greater surface roughness, beta-Ti has greater frictional resistance, it turns out that as the titanium content of an alloy increases, its surface reactivity increases, and the surface chemistry is a major influence on frictional behavior. Thus, beta-Ti, at 80% titanium, has a higher coefficient of friction than NiTi at 50% titanium, and there is greater frictional resistance to sliding with either than with steel.\nKey Concept\nAlthough NiTi has greater surface roughness, beta-Ti has greater frictional resistance.\nRef: Proffit 4th edition page 378",

Next generation sequencing & Sanger's technique are for DNA sequencing. ADDITIONAL EDGE: Used to detect RNA expression Sample here is RNA. This RNA is conveed to cDNA by enzyme reverse transcriptase. Tth polymerase (Thermus thermophilus HB-8) has Polymerase as well as reverse transcriptase activity when mixed with manganese ions and can thus be used for the amplification of RNA to cDNA. This polymerase is thermostable but does not has proofreading activity. So it is usually combined with a proofreading enzyme.",

            "Explanation": "Red cell precursors formed in the bone marrow from the erythroid (CFU\u2013E) progenitor cells are called erythroblasts or normoblasts. These divide and acquire haemoglobin, which turns the cytoplasm pink; the nucleus condenses and is extruded from the cell. The \ufb01rst non-nucleated red cell is a reticulocyte, which still contains ribosomal material in the cytoplasm, giving these large cells a faint blue tinge (\u2018polychromasia\u2019). Reticulocytes lose their ribosomal material and mature over 3 days, during which time they are released into the circulation. Increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes (reticulocytosis) reflect increased erythropoiesis.\nProliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors is stimulated by erythropoietin, a polypeptide hormone produced by renal interstitial peritubular cells in response to hypoxia. Failure of erythropoietin production in patients with renal failure causes anaemia, which can be treated with exogenous recombinant erythropoietin or similar pharmacological agents called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, e.g. darbepoetin.\nReference: : Davidson P R I N C I P L E S\u00a0 \u00a0and Practice O F M E D I C I N E 23rd edition page no\u00a0 915",

B: Obstruction of lymphatic ductsInflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a very aggressive type of breast cancer in which the cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin of the breast.This type of breast cancer is called \"inflammatory\" because the breast often looks swollen and red, or \"inflamed\", sometimes overnight, and can be misdiagnosed as mastitis.Invasion of the local lymphatic ducts impairs drainage and causes edematous swelling of the breast. Because the skin of the breast is tethered by the suspensory ligament of Cooper, the accumulation of fluid may cause the skin of the breast to assume a dimpled appearance similar to an orange peel (peau d'orange).IBC is sometimes misdiagnosed as an insect bite or breast infection. In the case of IBC, a lump is usually not present as in other forms of breast cancer.",

            "Explanation": "Preanaesthetic medication refers to the use of drugs before anaesthesia to make it safe and less unpleasant. When inhalation anaesthetic are given they inhibit the ciliary function therefore secretions in the respiratory pathway are not removed so we have to stop the secretions by administration of anti cholinergic drugs like atropine or glycopyrrolate. Glycopyrrolate is twice as potent and longer acting quaternary antimuscarinic which does not produce central effects. Antisecretory action is more marked than atropine and tachycardia is less marked. It acts rapidly when given i.v. and is the preferred antimuscarinic in anaesthetic practice.",

SeleniumBlind staggers are no longer believed to be caused by selenium but by sulfate toxicity due to the consumption of high-sulfate alkali water and/or high sulfur-containing forages.Since Sulfate is not mentioned in Question we will go for selenium.Excess sulfate (>1% of diet) leads to polioencephalomalacia and the classical signs of blind staggers.Blind StaggersThis syndrome may occur within a brief period (a few days to a few weeks) after the animal has begun to take in very high dietary levels of selenium. The symptoms of this condition are: impaired vision, a depressed appetite, and wandering in circlesProlonged oral exposure of cattle to elevated dietary selenium (Se) is associated historically with 2 clinical syndromes:Alkali disease.\"Blind staggers\".These two syndromes are not necessarily independent of one another. An animal may have only symptoms of one or the other or a combination of the symptoms of both. Both are associated with cardiac and skeletal muscle damage as well as hepatic damage.",

Most intraoral machines use 60 to 70 kVp. The availability of constant-potential (fully rectified), high-frequency or direct current (DC)\u00a0dental X-ray units have made possible the production of radiographs with lower kilovoltage and at reduced levels of radiation. The surface exposure required to produce a comparable radiographic density using a constant-potential unit is approximately 25% less than that of a conventional self-rectified unit operating at the same kilovoltage. At the present time, several manufacturers produce DC units.\nThus, in intraoral radiograph, patient radiation is not decreased by decreasing kVp.\n\u00a0Reference: White and Pharoah's Oral Radiology Principles and Interpretation 7th edition page no 36",

Do not overlook fracture of tooth and alveolar ridge.\nReimplant the tooth gently with firm finger pressure. Ask the patient to bite down firmly on a piece of gauze to help stabilize the tooth.\nAfter evaluating the occlusion, stabilize the tooth if required. Ideal splint required for an avulsed tooth is a flexible splint. The commonly used flexible splints are made of Gortex, metallic mesh stripes, synthetic clothes or orthodontic wire. A thick strip of composite bonded to the avulsed and the adjacent teeth also act as a splint.\n\nThe splint should engage several teeth around the avulsed tooth and it should be kept in place for not more than 7 to 10 days.\n\nContinue with the same treatment as above.\n\nTooth with open apex:\n\nClean the root surface with saline.\nExamine the alveolar socket after cleaning it with saline.\nCover the root surface with minocycline hydrochloride microspheres before reimplanting to kill bacteria which could enter the immature apex and form an abscess.\nContinue with the same treatment as above.\n\nRef: Textbook of endodontics, Nisha Garg and Amit Garg, 3rd edition, pg no:477",

            "Correct Option": "B",
            "Explanation": "If a patient provided history that a tooth has been avulsed and it can be determined that the injury is without other oral. neurologic, or higher-priority physical complications. it is best to replace it in the socket immediately and to hold it in place with light finger pressure.\nIf the avulsion occurred in a clean environment, nothing should be done to the tooth before replants it. If the tooth is dirty, an attempt should be made to clean the root surface, but it is very important to preserve any remnants of the periodontal ligament that are still attached to the root. 'therefore the parent would then be instructed to keep the tooth immersed in a suitable storage medium and bring the child and the tooth for immediate care.\nThe patient should receive immediate attention after arriving at the dental office; and if it seems any contamination than it should be rinse thoroughly with saline only do not attempt to scrub tooth by any means to prevent vitality of periodontal fibers and re-implant it in socket.\nIf patient or parent cannot or will not replant it than procedure to maintain vitality of tooth\nAllowing the avulsed tooth to dehydrate before replantation is damaging to a favourable prognosis.\nHanks buffered saline, isotonic saline, and pasteurized bovine milk may be the most favourable known storage media. If none of these solutions is readily available, human saliva is acceptable short-term substitute storage liquid. Presumably, the patient's saliva (and perhaps blood) would be readily available.\nAlthough tap water has been a commonly recommended storage solution (and its use would be preferable to allowing dehydration of the tooth), saliva is a better storage medium. Neither water nor saliva is as good as milk or saline, if the tooth must be stored for a long period (more than 30 minutes before replantation). Because water is hypotonic, its use leads to rapid cell lysis and increased inflammation on replantation.",

Clinically, Staphylococcus aureus sepsis presents like that documented for sepsis due to other bacteria. Septicemic shock is not directly caused due to toxins and other virulence factors play a role like protein A, fibrinolysin and coagulase, which are anti-phagocytic, suppress host immunity and helps in the spread of infection. Septicemia is mainly due to endotoxin tike activity as seen in Gram-negative bacilli and not due to exotoxin. S.aureus produces free types of toxin: cytotoxins, pyrogenic toxin superantigens, and exfoliative toxins. Both epidemiologic data and studies in animals suggest that antitoxin antibodies are protective against illness in TSS' staphylococcal food poisoning, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). Illness develops after toxin synthesis and absorption and the subsequent toxin-initiated host response",

            "Explanation": "Ans. D: VancomycinVancomycins bind to the peptides of the peptidoglycan monomers and block both the formation of gycosidic bonds between the sugars by the transgycosidase enzymes and the formation of the peptide cross-links by the transpeptidase enzymes. This results in a weak cell wall and osmotic lysis of the bacterium.The fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, etc.) work by inhibiting one or more of a group of enzymes called topoisomerase, enzymes needed for supercoiling, replication and separation of circular bacterial DNA.For example, DNA gyrase is a topoisomerase that catalyzes the negative supercoiling of the circular DNA found in bacteria. Topoisomerase IV, on the other hand, is involved in the relaxation of the supercoiled circular DNA, enabling the separation of the interlinked daughter chromosomes at the end of bacterial DNA replication.In gram-positive bacteria, the main target for fluoroquinolones is DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II), an enzyme responsible for supercoiling of bacterial DNA during DNA replication; in gram-negative bacteria, the primary target is topoisomerase IV, an enzyme responsible for relaxation of supercoiled circular DNA and separation of the inter-linked daughter chromosomes.The tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline, demeclocycline, minocycline, etc.) block bacterial translation by binding reversibly to the 30S subunit and distoing it in such a way that the anticodons of the charged tRNAs cannot align properly with the codons of the mRNA.The aminoglycosides (streptomycin, neomycin, netilmicin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin, etc.) bind irreversibly to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes.",

If retinal degeneration or detachment is present, patients may also repo light flashes and floaters, which are associated with retina changes. Those with degenerative myopia have an increased incidence of cataract formation (nuclear cataracts are most typical).Some of the most typical features of degenerative myopia are:Vitreous liquefaction and posterior vitreous detachmentPeripapillary atrophy appearing as temporal choroidal or scleral crescents or rings around the optic discLattice degeneration in the peripheral retinaTilting or malinseion of the optic disc, usually associated with myopic conusThinning of the retinal pigment epithelium with resulting atrophic appearance of the fundusEctasia of the sclera posteriorly (posterior staphyloma)Breaks in Bruch's membrane and choriocapillaris, resulting in lines across the fundus called \"lacquer cracks\"Fuchs spot in the macular area.",

This addition is appropriate when the casting alloy is gold, but there is disagreement regarding the effects of carbon in phosphate investments used for casting silver-palladium alloys, palladium-silver alloys, or base metal alloys. It is believed that carbon can embrittle the alloys, even though the investment is heated to temperatures that burn out the carbon. Some evidence indicates that palladium reacts with carbon at temperatures above 1504 \u00b0C. Thus, if the casting temperature of an alloy with high palladium content exceeds this critical point, a phosphate investment without carbon should be used.\nRef: Phillip\u2019s 12th edition page 208",

            "Correct Answer": "Gastroschisis",
            "Correct Option": "C",
            "Explanation": "Friends, many questions are asked on serum alpha fetoprotein, therefore basic knowledge of this protein is quite vital.\nAlpha Fetoprotein:\n\nIt is a glycoprotein\u00a0synthesized by the fetal yolk sac\u00a0in the early weeks of gestation and by the gastrointestinal tract\u00a0and liver\u00a0later.\nIt is the most abundant protein in the fetal serum.\nIt circulates in fetal serum and passes into fetal urine and amniotic fluid.\nConcentration of AFP increases steadily in fetal serum till 13 weeks, (3 mg/ml) after which the level rapidly decreases throughout the rest of pregnancy.\nAFP level in fetal serum declines following birth and by one year of age, its concentration is 1 ng/ml which persists throughout life.\nAFP passes from the fetus to amniotic fluid when fetus passes urine.\nIt passes into the maternal serum by diffusion across the placental membranes and via placental circulation and is found in steadily increasing quantities in maternal serum after 12 weeks.\n\nThese are the usual ways of entry of serum alfa fetoprotein in maternal serum but serum alfa fetoprotein can find its way in maternal serum in other ways too.\n\nOpen fetal body wall defects uncoverd by integument permit allows additional AFP to leak into the amniotic fluid and thus maternal serum AFP are increased. This is the reason for increase in serum alpha fetoprotein in neural tube defects and ventral wall defects.\nMaternal screening is done between 15-20 weeks (according to Williams 23/e, p 289, Fernando Arias 3/e, p 58).\nIt is measured in nanograms per ml and reported as a multiple of the median (MOM).\nMSAFP of 2.5 MOM is considered as the upper limit of normal (for twin pregnancy it is 3.5 MOM).\n\nNow after having this basic knowledge lets have a look at the question.\nIn the question alpha fetoprotein will be increased in the following conditions.\n\nGastroschisis \u2013 Ventral wall defect\nOmphalocele \u2013 Ventral wall defect\nSpina bifida occulta \u2013 Neural tube defect\n\nIn Down\u2019s syndrome - AFP levels are decreased.\nSpina bifida occulta:\nSpina bifida occulta is usually a small, clinically asymptomatic defect, covered by skin, so there are less chances of mixing of fetal serum and maternal serum. Therefore the maternal serum alphafetoprotein level usually does not increase in spina bifida occulta.\n\u201cIn the fetus with a defect such as anencephaly or spina bifida, AFP enters the amniotic fluid in increased amounts, leading to higher levels in the maternal serum as well. Levels of AFP are elevated in amniotic fluid and maternal serum only when such lesions are \u201copen,\u201d i.e., when the neural tissue is exposed or covered by only a thin membrane. When NTDs are skin-covered, AFP does not escape from the fetal circulation, and such defects are generally not detected by maternal serum AFP (MSAFP) screening\u201d.\nUSG in Obs. and Gyane by Callen 4/e, p 25\nOmphalocele:\u00a0\nFernando Arias 3/e, p 84\nIt is a midline defect of the anterior abdominal wall characterized by herniation of the abdominal viscera into the base of the umbilical cord.\nThe protruding organs are typically covered by a thin aminoperitoneal membrane. Omphalocele has a strong association with high levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein because the ventral wall defect allows mixing of fetal and maternal circulation.\nGastroschisis:\nFernando Arias 2/e, p 83\nGastroschisis is a paraumbilical defect of the anterior abdominal wall, through which abdominal viscera herniates. The defect is usually located on the right side of the cord insertion and compromises the full thickness of the abdominal wall. There is no sac or membrane covering the herniated organs. This defect is associated with high alpha feto protein titre.\nBoth gastroschisis and omphalocele are ventral wall defects containing abdominal organs and both are associated with high alphafetoprotein level in maternal serum.\nBut it is likely that alphafetoprotein level will be higher in patients with gastroschisis as there is no sac or membrane which covers the herniated organs in this defect. So there is more possibility of fetoprotein leak into the maternal serum or amniotic fluid in Gastroschisis. The answer is further supported by the following graph from\nUSG in Obs. and Gynae by Callen 4/e, p 28",

Incomplete rupture is commonly referred to as scar dehiscence.\nScar dehiscence is an intraoperative finding always. The greatest risk factor for either complete or incomplete uterine rupture is prior cesarean delivery.\nFollowing uterine rupture the most common electronic fetal monitoring finding is sudden, severe heart rate decelerations that may evolve into late decelerations, bradycardia, and undetectable fetal heart action.\nIn some cases in which the fetal presenting part has entered the pelvis with labor, loss of station may be detected by pelvic examination. If the fetus is partly or totally extruded from the site of uterine rupture, abdominal palpitation or vaginal examination may be helpful to identify the presenting part, which will have moved away from the pelvic inlet.\nA firm contracted uterus may at times be felt alongside the fetus. With rupture and expulsion of the fetus into the peritoneal cavity, the chances for intact fetal survival are dismal, and reported morality rates range from 50% to 75%.\nClinical features of Ruptured Uterus:",

It gives secretomotor fibers to the pterygopalatine ganglion along with lesser petrosal nerve. The postganglionic fibers innervate the lacrimal gland and are responsible for the formation of tears.Greater petrosal nerve damage will deprive the lacrimal gland of its secretomotor fibers and this would lead to the absence of tears.Greater petrosal nerve damage can happen in case of intrapetrosal mass lesions, a trauma in case of temporal bone injuries, etc.",

Ramus height increases 1\u00a0to 2 mm per year and body length increases 2 to 3 mm per year. These cross-sectional data tend to smooth out the juvenile and pubertal growth spurts, which do occur in growth of the mandible.\nGrowth in length and height of both jaws continues through the period of puberty.\nSince the age of the child is less than 6 years and growth spurts are yet to occur.

So, lumbar puncture (for CSF examination) is not required on emergency evaluation in the above mentioned patient.Altered sensorium in a patient of Turbercular meningitis, who was taking ATT from the last one month maybe due toHepatic encephalopathy secondary to hepatotoxicity of ATT.

By the beginning of second trimester, it consists largely of extracellular fluid which diffuses through the fetal skin, and thus reflects the composition of fetal plasma\u201d.\nAfter 20 weeks, however, the cornification of fetal skin prevents this diffusion and amniotic fluid is composed largely of fetal urine.\u201d\nWilliams Obs. 23/e, p 88, 89\nReading the above text, it can be concluded that in early pregnancy - Mother is the main contributor whereas during rest of the pregnancy - Fetus is the main contributor.",

When this material is heated at temperatures sufficiently high to completely dehydrate the investment and to ensure complete castings, it shrinks considerably and occasionally fractures.\nA mixture of silica and calcinated gypsum powder (calcium sulfate hemihydrate, CaSO4\u2022 1/2 H2O) results in setting expansion greater than that of the gypsum product used alone. The silica particles probably interfere with the intermeshing and interlocking of the crystals as they form. Thus, the thrust of the crystals is outward during growth, and they increase expansion.\nThinner mix of a gypsum-bonded investment will decrease setting expansion.",

Its surface may have a smooth, lobulated, or, occasionally, warty appearance that is erythematous and often ulcerated. Depending on the age of the lesion, the texture varies from soft to firm and is suggestive of an ulcerated fibroma.\u00a0\nBecause of the pronounced vascularity of these lesions, they often bleed easily when probed.\nHistologically, the pyogenic granuloma presents as a remarkable proliferation of plump fibroblasts and endothelial cells with the formation of prominent numbers of\u00a0 thin-walled, endothelium-lined vascular channels. A polymorphous inflammatory cell infiltrate is present, and the overlying surface epithelium is often ulcerated. Treatment consists of surgical excision, with care being taken to completely remove any local irritant that may still be present that would predispose to recurrence of the lesion.\nReference: McDONALD AND AVERY\u2019S DENTISTRY for the CHILD and ADOLESCENT, 10th ed page no 604,605",

Sodium fluoride - it inhibits enolase enzyme thus inhibits glycolysis process , so it is used for glucose estimation . Citrate - 3.2%Trisodium citrate - it is used for the determining the value of ESR and is also used for doing any kind of coagulation study. All the three (sodium EDTA, sodium fluoride, trisodium citrate) above use sodium. therefore, if we use any of these chemicals for the purpose of Serum Electrolyte measurement, the value of sodium and other electrolytes are going to be altered. So WHO recommends that for the purpose of Serum Electrolyte measurement we use an anticoagulant Lithium Heparin. It doesn't cause any alterations in the serum electrolytes.",

            "Explanation": "Ans. D. False True False True TrueEmergency care providers should check the victim's pulse for at least 5 seconds but no longer than 10 seconds. For children aged one to adolescence, the pulse should be checked at the carotid aery. In infants, the brachial pulse should be assessed.If there is a palpable pulse within 10 seconds, then a rescue breath should be given every 3 seconds. Breaths should last one second and the chest should be observed for visible rise. If the victim has an advanced airway, then the provider should administer breaths 10-12 times per minute.If the pulse is less than 60/minute, or if the victim has signs of poor perfusion after adequate ventilation and oxygenation, the provider should begin chest compressions. In the absence of a pulse, a lone rescuer should begin CPR with 30 high quality compressions followed by two breaths. If two healthcare providers are available, the cycle of compressions to breaths should be 15:2 (pediatrics).High quality compressions in CPR should be a minimum of 1/3 the AP diameter of the chest, or approximately 1 1/2 inches in infants (4 cm) and 2\" in children from age one to adolescence. The rate of compressions should be 100-120 per minute. Chest recoil should be complete between compressions.Pediatric compression is performed with the head of one hand over the lower 1/2 of the sternum, between the nipples. In infants, use two fingers, or use the thumb encircling technique if multiple providers are available",

The remaining 75% of cases arise as de novo events and convey a low recurrence risk of approximately 1%\nIf, however, a parent is shown to be a carrier then there will be a significant risk that a future child will be affected, usually of the order of 2-5% for a carrier male and 10-15% for a carrier female.\nIn the very rare event that a parent carries a balanced 21q21e Robertsonian translocation, the risk of Down's\u00a0\u00a0 drome in liveborn offs rin\u2022 will be 100%.\n\n\u200bRisk of abnormal offspring for a carrier of a balanced translocation",

Its formation in liver is dependant on fat soluble vitamin K. Absorption of vitamin K occurs with bile acid. In cholestasis absorption of bile acid (vitamin K) is not affected, rather there is accumulation of bile acids, so levels of vitamin K and clotting factors dependant on vitamin K are also normal. The prothrombin time therefore, remains normal in cholestasis.\nOnly when ursodeoxycholic acid or cholestyramine are being given to patients of cholestasis. Prothrombin time needs to be monitored because these drugs decrease the absorption of bile acids and can therefore cause prolongation of prothrombin time.",

            "Correct Option": "B",
            "Explanation": "Positional veigo/ BPPV: It is characterized by veigo when the head is placed in a ceain critical position. There is no hearing loss or other neurologic symptoms. Positional testing establishes the diagnosis and helps to differentiate it from positional veigo of central origin. Disease caused by a disorder of posterior semicircular canal though many patients have history of head trauma and ear infection. It has been demonstrated that otoconial debris, consisting of crystals and calcium carbonate, is released from the degeneration macula of the utricle and floats freely in the endolymph. When it settles on the cupula of posterior semicircular canal in a critical head position, it causes displacement of the cupula and veigo. The veigo is fatigable on assuming the same position repeatedly due to dispersal of the otoconia but can be induced again after a period of rest. Thus, typical history and Hallpike maneuver establishes the diagnosis. The condition can be treated by performing Epley's maneuver. The principle of this maneuver is to reposition the otoconial debris from the posterior semicircular canal back into the utricle. The doctor stands behind the patient and the assistant on the side. The patient is made to sit on the table so that when he is made to lie down, his head is beyond the edge of the table as is done in Dix-Hallpike maneuver. His face is turned 450 to the affected side. The maneuver consists of five positions * Position 1. With the head turned 450, the patient is made to lie down in head-hanging position (Dix-Hallpike). It will cause veigo and nystagmus. Wait till veigo and nystagmus subside. * Position 2. Head is now turned so that affected ear is facing up at a 900 rotation. * Position 3. The whole body and head are now rotated away from the affected ear to a lateral recumbent position in a 900 -rotation face-down position. * Position 4. Patient is now brought to a sitting position with head still turned to the unaffected side by 450. * Position 5. The head is now turned forward and chin brought down 200. There should be a pause at each position till there is no nystagmus or there is slowing of nystagmus, before changing to the next position. After maneuver is complete, patient should maintain an upright posture for 48 h. Eighty percent of the patients will be cured by a single maneuver. If the patients remain symptomatic, the maneuver can be repeated. A bone vibrator placed on the mastoid bone helps to loosen the debris. - Meniere's disease: Has an episodic veigo and it lasts for >20 minutes. - Vestibular neuronitis: Veigo lasts for many days. - Labyrinthitis: There is a history of fever and trauma, and the veigo lasts for days.",

The nerve fiber supplying Golgi tendon organ ramifies into many branches. Each branch ends in the form of a knob.\u00a0\nFUNCTIONS OF GOLGI TENDON ORGAN\nGolgi tendon organ gives response to the change in the force or tension developed in the skeletal muscle during contraction. It is also the receptor for inverse stretch reflex and lengthening reaction and thereby prevents damage of muscle due to overstretching.",

This is the only life saving measure. Adrenaline should not be injected i.v. (can itself be fatal) unless shock is immediately life threatening. If adrenaline is to be injected i. v., it should be diluted to 1:10,000 or 1:100,000 and infused slowly with constant monitoring. * Administer a H1 antihistaminic (pheniramine 20-40 mg or chlorpheniramine I 0-20 mg) i.m./slow i.v. It may have adjuvant value.* Intravenous glucocoicoid (hydrocoisone sod. succinate 200 mg) should be added in severe/recurrent cases. It acts slowly, but is specially valuable for prolonged reactions and in asthmatics. It may be followed by oral prednisolone for 3 days.",

Psoas abscesses may arise from a hematogenous source, by contiguous spread from an intra- abdominal or pelvic process, or by contiguous spread from nearby bony structures (e.g., veebral bodies). Associated osteomyelitis due to spread from bone to muscle or from muscle to bone is common in psoas abscesses. When pott's disease was common, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was a frequent cause of psoas abscess. Currently, either S. aureus or a mixture of enteric organisms including aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli is usually isolated from psoas abscesses in the United States. S. aureus is most likely to be isolated when a psoas abscess arises from hematogenous spread or a contiguous focus of osteomyelitis; a mixed enteric flora is the most likely etiology when the abscess has an intra- abdominal or pelvic source. Patients with psoas abscesses frequently present with fever, lower abdominal or back pain, or pain referred to the hip or knee. CT is the most useful diagnostic technique.\"- Harrison 19/e p852 \"Spinal TB (Pott's disease or tuberculous spondylitis) often involves two or more adjacent veebral bodies. Whereas the upper thoracic spine is the most common site of spinal TB in children, the lower thoracic and upper lumbar veebrae are usually affected in adults. From the anterior superior or inferior angle of the veebral body, the lesion slowly reaches the adjacent body, later affecting the interveebral disk. With advanced disease, collapse of veebral bodies results in kyphosis (gibbus). A paraveebral \"cold\" abscess may also form. In the upper spine, this abscess may track to and penetrate the chest wall, presenting as a soft tissue mass; in the lower spine, it may reach the inguinal ligaments or present as a psoas abscess. \"Harrison 19/e p1110",

Dense old scars may undergo hyaline degeneration and subsequent calcification.2. Atheromas in the aoa and coronaries frequently undergo calcification.3. Mo?nckeberg's sclerosis shows calcification in the tunica media of muscular aeries in elderly people.4. The stroma of tumors such as uterine fibroids, breast cancer, thyroid adenoma, goiter, etc shows calcification.5. Some tumors show characteristic spherules of calcification called psammoma bodies or calcospherites such as in meningioma, papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.6. Cysts that have been present for a long time may show calcification of their walls e.g. epidermal and pilar cysts.7. Calcinosis cutis is a condition of unknown cause in which there are irregular nodular deposits of calcium salts in the skin and subcutaneous tissue.8. Senile degenerative changes may be accompanied by dystrophic calcification such as in coastal cailages, tracheal or bronchial cailages, and pineal glands in the brain, etc.",

This is called breastmilk jaundice.\nA bilirubin level of over 20 mg/dl may be attained. (It is presumed to be due to inhibitory substances in the breastmilk that interfere with bilirubin conjugation e.g. pregananediol and free fatty acids).\nTemporary interruption of breastmilk feeds will dramatically reduce the serum levels of bilirubin and there may be slight increase in bilirubin when breast feeding is resumed, but it never reaches the previous levels. Hypothyroidism \u00a0\nPersistent elevation of indirect bilirubin is the first sign of congenital hypothyroidism in neonates.\nThis is due to decreased activity of UDPGT for weeks or months after birth.\nAt least 10% of all infants with congenital hypothyroidism will have jaundice as the presenting symptom.\nTreatment with thyroxine promptly alleviates jaundice.\n\nG-6PD deficiency \n\nThere is hemolytic anemia that results in increased production of unconjugated bilirubin.",

HHV-8 infection is more common in pas of Africa than in the United States. Primary HHV-8 infection in immunocompetent children may manifest as fever and maculopapular rash. Among individuals with intact immunity, chronic asymptomatic infection is the rule, and neoplastic disorders generally develop only after subsequent immunocompromise. In patients with AIDS, effective antiretroviral therapy has caused improvement in HHV-8-related disease. The virus is sensitive to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir, but the clinical benefit has not been demonstrated in trials.

Slow waves 2. Spikes Slow waves: - Most gastro intestinal contractions occur rhythmically & this rhythm is determined mainly by frequency of 'slow waves' - These are not action potentials, instead they are slow undulating changes in resting membrane potential - These waves are caused by complex interactions among smooth muscle cells & interstitial cells of cajal. - Slow waves usually do not themselves cause muscle contraction (except in stomach) instead they mainly excite appearance of intermittent spike potential & spike potentials in turn actually excite muscle contraction. Parasympathetic neurons - depolarize smooth muscle cell & makes muscle fibers more excitable. Smooth muscle contraction occurs in response to entry of calcium ions into muscle fiber.

Methyl mercury is a major safety concern because it bioaccumulates through the food chain; its pharmacokinetic half-life is longer (1.5 to 3 months) than that of ethyl mercury (less than 1 week). In air, the concentrations of mercury range from about 0.01 to 0.02 \u00b5g/m3.\nMercury accumulates in the kidneys. In the brain, metallic mercury can be converted to an inorganic form that is retained in the brain. Elemental mercury and mercury vapor have a half-life of 1 to 3 months. Mercury leaves the body by excretion through urine and feces.\nExposure to high levels of mercury can injure the brain, kidneys, and developing fetus. Chronic mercury toxicity may be manifested as tremors; memory loss; and changes in personality, vision, and hearing.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 124",

Ricketts\u2019 E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. A quick method to look at one profile is to imagine a line tangent from the lower chin to the nose tip. Cephalometrically, Ricketts\u2019 E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. Normal values suggest that the upper lip is 4 mm behind the E line, while the lower lip lies 2 mm behind this reference line. It is important to mention that, this reference line is influenced a great deal by the growth of the nose and also varies with age and sex. Ricketts recommended that lip position should be analyzed using the nose\u2013chin line as a reference point. These values are for Caucasians and clearly cannot be applied to all races.\nRef: Orthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities, 3e, Om P. Kharbanda pdf no 1097",

The primers hybridize with their complementary single-stranded DNA produced in the first step.Step 3: Polymerization: New DNA strands are synthesized by Taq polymerase. This enzyme is derived from bacteria Thermus aquaticus that are found in hot springs.The steps of 1,2 and 3 are repeated. In each cycle, the DNA strands are doubled. Thus, 20 cycles provide for 1 million times amplifications. These cycles are generally repeated by automated instrument, called Tempcycler.5. After the amplification procedure, DNA hybridization technique or Southern blot analysis with a suitable probe shows the presence of the DNA in the sample tissue.Dideoxyribonucleotides are not used in the polymerase chain reaction.",

Acute rheumatic carditis is a common manifestation of active RF and may progress over time to chronic rheumatic hea disease (RHD), mainly manifesting as valvular abnormalities. RHD is characterized principally by deforming fibrotic valvular disease, paicularly involving the mitral valve; indeed, RHD is viually the only cause of mitral stenosis Type of necrosis seen in RHD - Fibrinoid necrosis. Morphology: Distinctive lesions occur in the hea, called Aschoff bodies, consisting of foci of T lymphocytes, occasional plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cell (pathognomonic fo RF).These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to-ovoid nuclei (occasionally binucleate) in which the chromatin condenses into a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation \"caterpillar cells\").",

This is surprising when considering that severe leakage takes place at its margins.\u00a0\nAlso, the incidence of contact caries is less when compared to amalgam restorations (contact caries is the term applied to caries occurring on the proximal surface of the tooth adjacent to the restoration).\u00a0\nThe anti-cariogenic property is due to presence of 15% fluoride. Fluoride release is slow and occurs throughout the life of the restoration.\u00a0Silicate cement was classed as a severe irritant to the pulp because of its low pH (acidic).\u00a0\nFor many years, silicate served as a standard for comparing the pulpal response to other materials. In deep cavities, the pulp had to be protected with varnish or calcium hydroxide.\n\nManapallil 3rd Ed P: 88",

Congenital heart disease and Mitral valve prolapse have the best prognosis\nSo now this question becomes very easy-Mitarl vave prolapse has the best prognosis, so it is ruled out; Regurgitant lesions have a better prognosis than stenotic lesions so mitral regurgitation is also ruled out. Now we are left with 2 options, aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis-as I said go alphabetically, aortic stenosis will have a worse prognosis than pulmonary.\nLet\u2019s consider each of the options one by one and see what Williams has to say about each of them.\nOption \u201ca\u201d Mitral regurgitation\n\u201cM R is well-tolerated during pregnancy probably due to decreased systemic vascular resistance which actually results in less regurgitation.

Bacteria adherent to lining vaginal epithelial cellsGardnerella vaginalis, facultatively anaerobic gram-variable rod, is one of the organisms responsible for bacterial vaginosis (BV).The vaginal discharge of BV is characteristically described as a thin, gray, homogeneous fluid that is adherent to the vaginal mucosa. A fishy vaginal odour, which is paicularly noticeable following coitusis present.Demonstration of clue cells on a saline smear is the most specific criterion for diagnosing BV.The whiff test may be positive in up to 70% of BV patients.The vaginal discharge of patients with BV is notable for its lack of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), typically 1 or less than 1 PMN per vaginal epithelial cell.",

Twins\nii. Babies born to diabetic mothers\niii. In polyhydramines\n\nSingle umbilical artery has been associated with congenital malformations of the fetus in 10-20% cases viz- Renal & Genital anomalies and fetal Trisomy\nThere is increased incidence of abortions, prematurity, IUGR and increased perinatal mortality.\n\nOption d- insulin can be given\nThere is no doubt as far as this option is concerned as insulin is the TOC for controlling hyperglycemia in case of diabetes in pregnancy.\nSo from above discussion it is clear that option \u2018b\u2019 is absolutely incorrect, so we are opting it out.",

Scavenges nitrogenPhenylbutyrate is used to treat urea cycle disorders, because its metabolites offer an alternative pathway to the urea cycle to allow excretion of excess nitrogen. Urea cycle disorders result in the accumulation of precursors of urea, principally ammonia and glutamine. Phenylbutyrate provides an alternate means of detoxfication of glutamine acetylation, which bypasses the urea cycle.",

Once transferrin is saturated with iron, any that has accumulated in the mucosal cells is lost when the cells are shed. Expression of the ferropoin gene is downregulated by hepcidin, a peptide secreted by the liver when body iron reserves are adequate. In response to hypoxia, anemia, or hemorrhage, the synthesis of hepcidin is reduced, leading to increased synthesis of ferropoin and increased iron absorption. As a result of this mucosal barrier, only ~10% of dietary iron is absorbed, and only 1 to 5% from many plant foods.",

Chemical fixatives can be considered as members of three major categories: coagulant, cross-linking, and compound. Coagulant fixatives: Both organic and non-organic solutions may coagulate proteins making them insoluble. Cellular architecture in vivo is maintained primarily by lipoproteins and fibrous proteins such as collagen. Coagulating these proteins maintains tissue histomorphology at the light microscope level. Unfounately, because coagulant fixatives result in cytoplasmic flocculation and poor preservation of mitochondria and secretory granules, these fixatives are not useful in ultrastructural analysis. Examples: Ethanol, methanol, acetone, picric acid and trichloroacetic acid Cross-linking fixatives: Several chemicals were selected as fixatives secondary to their potential actions of forming cross-links both within and between proteins and nucleic acids. Examples include formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and other aldehydes, e.g. chloral hydrate and glyoxal, as well as metal salts, e.g. mercuric and zinc chloride, and other metallic compounds, e.g. osmium tetroxide. useful for electron microscopic examination - Glutraldehyde (best one)/formaldehyde/osmium tetraoxide Compound fixatives: Alcoholic formalin",

DThe epidermis is composed of 4 or 5 layers, depending on the region of skin being considered.Those layers in descending order are:Cornified layer (stratum corneum)Composed of 10 to 30 layers of polyhedral, anucleated corneocytes (final step of keratinocyte differentiation), with the palms and soles having the most layers.Clear/translucent layer (stratum lucidum, only in palms and soles)This narrow layer is found only on the palms and soles. The epidermis of these two areas is known as \"thick skin\" because with this extra layer, the skin has 5 epidermal layers instead of 4Granular layer (stratum granulosum)Keratinocytes lose their nuclei and their cytoplasm appears granular. Lipids, contained into those keratinocytes within lamellar bodies, are released into the extracellular space through exocytosis to form a lipid barrier. Those polar lipids are then conveed into non-polar lipids and arranged parallel to the cell surface.Spinous layer (stratum spinosum)Keratinocytes become connected through desmosomes and sta produce lamellar bodies, from within the Golgi, enriched in polar lipids, glycosphingolipids, free sterols, phospholipids and catabolic enzymes.Langerhans cells, immunologically active cells, are located in the middle of this layer.Basal/germinal layer (stratum basale/germinativum).Composed mainly of proliferating and non-proliferating keratinocytes, attached to the basement membrane by hemidesmosomes.Melanocytes are present, connected to numerous keratinocytes in this and other strata through dendrites.Merkel cells are also found in the stratum basale with large numbers in touch-sensitive sites such as the fingeips and lips.",

            "Explanation": "Neonatal behavioral assessment scale\n\nNeonatal Behavioural Assessment Scale (NBAS) is used to support parents in the neonatal unit, especially around discharge home. The aim is to increase parents' confidence in understanding their baby.\nAn infant's reaction are state related. So it is extremely important that observations of state be considered as a starting point from which all other observations are made.\nThe ideal time to administer the examination is when the infant is asleep and midway between feeding cycles.\n\nScores \nSleep states\n\nState 1 : Sleep with regular breathing, eyes closed, no spontaneous activity except startles or jerky movements at quite regular intervals.\n\na State 2 : Sleep with eyes closed; rapid eye movements can often be observed under closed lids; low activity level with random movements and startles.\nAwake states\n\nState 3 : Drowsy or semidrowsy; eyes may be open but dull and heavy lidded, or closed, eyelids fluttering; activity level minimal, Movements are usually smooth, although there may be startles. Some infants may also show fuss/cry vocalizations in this state. What distinguishes state 3 from state 5 when both are accompanied by fuss/cry vocalizations is the minimal movement in state 3 and considerable movement in state 5.\nState 4 : Alert, eyes open with bright look. Motor activity is minimal; there can be a glazed look that is easily changed into a brighter look with appropriate stimulation.\n\n\nState 5 : Eyes likely to be open; considerable motor activity, with thrusting movements of the extremities, and even a few spontaneous startles; reactive to external stimulation with increase in startles or motor activity.\n\n\nState 6 : Crying : characterized by intense, loud, rhythmic, and sustained cry vocalizations that are difficult to break through with stimulation; motor activity is high.\n\nComing to the question\n\nAccording to above staging, the newborn in our question comes under state 6 (crying lustily, and moving all 4 limbs).\nIf you have any confusion, read the following facts on crying (state 6) :-\n\n\"it is important to distinguish between crying as a state (stage 6) from the fuss/ay vocalization that can occur in state 5 and even state 3. Some infants show repeated episodes of fuss /cry vocalization in state 5 but may not reach state 6. This may also be a maturational issue, because some preterm infants may not have energy reserves to sustain state 6. In general, state 6 Can be distinguished from state 5 by the intensity and sustained quality of the crying (at least 15 seconds) and unavailability of infant in state 6. Repeated brief episodes of cry /fuss in state 5 do not mean that the infant has moved into state 6. Examiners need to give the infant the opportunity to show state 6\"\n\nSo, crying lustily with all limbs moving (child in question), straight away goes in state 6.",

Allison/Tasuku Honjo for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation.James P. Allison studied a known protein that functions as a brake on the immune system. He realized the potential of releasing the brake and thereby unleashing our immune cells to attack tumors.Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-associated Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoints are negative regulators of T-cell immune function. Inhibition of these targets, resulting in increased activation of the immune system, has led to new immunotherapies for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other cancers.For several types of cancer, including lung cancer, renal cancer, lymphoma and melanoma checkpoint therapy against PD-1 has proven more effective and positive results found.But recent clinical studies indicate that for melanoma the combination therapy of both CTLA-4 and PD-1 is more effective.Thus, Allison and Honjo combine different strategies to release the brakes on the immune system with the aim of eliminating tumor cells even more efficiently.Their paper formed the basis of current cancer immunotherapy.But the original concept of cancer immunotherapy was discovered by William Bradley Coley (1872).",

INH is extensively metabolized in liver; most impoant pathway being N-acetylation by NAT2. The acetylated metabolite is excreted in urine. The rate of INH acetylation shows genetic variation. There are either: Fast acetylators: (30-40% of Indians) t1/2 of INH 1 hr. Slow acetylators: (60-70% of Indians) t1/2 of INH 3 hr. Slow acetylators will not be able to metabolize the drug quickly and there will be accumulation of isoniazid. Isoniazid inhibits pyridoxal phosphokinase enzyme and hence causes peripheral neuritis, paraesthesias, numbness etc. Pyridoxine given prophylactically (10mg/day) prevents this neurotoxicity. On the other hand, fast acetylators are more prone to develop.",

Both the hemoglobin and hematocrit are depressed, usually to a moderate degree, in association with hypochromia, microcytosis, and modest poikilocytosis. The serum iron and ferritin are low The total plasma iron-binding capacity (reflecting elevated transferrin levels) is high. Low serum iron with increased iron binding capacity results in a reduction of transferrin saturation to below 15%. Reduced iron stores inhibit hepcidin synthesis, and its serum levels fall. In uncomplicated iron deficiency, oral iron supplementation produces an increase in reticulocytes in about 5 to 7 days that is followed by a steady increase in blood counts and the normalization of red cell indices Earliest parameter to be affected in the Iron deficiency anemia patient - Serum ferritin. Gold standard for making the diagnosis of Iron deficiency anemia - Bone marrow examination (storage iron in the form of ferritin or protein hemosiderin can be detected with the help of stain Prussian blue.)",

When this happens, the peptide bonds in the hinge region are broken.The antigen-binding activity is associated with one of these fragments, the Fab poion- The second fragment is the Fc poion that is involved in the placental transfer, complement fixation, attachment to various cells, and other biologic activities.",

D: CoisoneFetal adrenals shows hyperophy of the reticular zone (fetal zone), which is the site of synthesis of oestriol precursor, coisol and dehydroepiandrosterone.After 12 weeks of gestation, the activity of 3 p-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B) decreases in fetal adrenal and sulfokinase activity increases.At that time (during the mid-gestation, 12 to 22 weeks) the major steroid products are DHEA and DHEA Sulfate (DHEA-S).During the mid-gestation (12 to 22 weeks), the aromatase activity and sulfokinase activity increases. So Placenta itself utilizes fetal DHEA and DHEA-S as substrate for estrone and estradiol as precursors.",

Phenomenon in which porcelain appears different under varying light condition is metamerism\nFluorescence: Natural tooth sometimes absorbsthe light of a shorter wavelength in addition to the wavelengths of the normal visible light. The energy the tooth absorbs by ultraviolet radiation is converted into the visible light of larger wavelengths. In such cases, the tooth itself becomes a source of light and this phenomenon is called fluorescence. Fluorescence contributes to the brightness and a vital appearance of the tooth.",

Growth of the nasomaxillary complex occurs by primary growth, secondary displacement and surface remodelling.\nThe maxilla displaces downward and forward due to sutural growth at its posterior margins, while surface resorptive changes lead to deepening of its facial surface. Drift is brought about by deposition on one side and resorption on the opposite side of the same cortical plate. The classical example of cortical drift is provided by growth of the facial surface of the maxilla.",

Of these, lithium heparin is best suited for most of the biochemical estimations. All other anticoagulants the/ate calcium and hence unsuitable for calcium estimation. The possibility of enzyme inhibition especially creatine kinase, ALP, ACP, amylase and LDH are observed with several of these anticoagulants.

But in young infants and boys who cannot ratract their foreskin, it is not reliable. Such samples will usually reflect periurethral and prepucial organisms and cells.\n\nCollection in an adhesive sealed sterile collection bag after disinfection of the genitals\n\n\nIs a useful technique in infants, but potential contamination from genitals and perianal area can occur.\n\n3. Urine specimen through catheterization or indwelling catheter \u2014\n\nUrine specimen through a catheter is less likely to be contaminated than the voided specimens as described above. It is also less invasive than suprapubic aspiration, but it is not as sensitive as suprapubic aspiration.\n\n\nA catherized specimen is reliable if the first portion of the urine that may contain urethral organisms is discarded and specimen is taken from later flow through the catheter, but it has the disadvantage of being traumatic and of potentially introducing urethral organisms into sterile bladder\n\n\nSuprapubic aspiration -\nSuprapubic aspiration is best method to collect urine specimen for culture.\nIt is the most reliable method\nIt can be performed safely in children and in premature infants by 21 or 22 gauge needle.\nThis procedure avoids any sort of contamination, however it is invasive. So it is used only in infants and selected patients.\nNote:\n\nThe sensitivity of suprapubic aspiration is 99 %\n\nThe sensitivity of catherization is 95%",

In negative feedback, the controller does the opposite, the change is negated or error is minimized. In positive feedback mechanism, controller does the same in direction of error & error is amplified. If the BP is increased, baroreceptor acts in a way as to decrease it or vice- versa. Increased pressure in blood vessels containing baroreceptor causes increased impulse firing. Baroreceptor signal enters the nucleus tractus solitarius, inhibit the vasoconstrictor center of the medulla, excite the vagal center. The net effects are inhibition of sympathetic activity, which causes vasodilation of veins & aerioles, decreased hea rate & strength of hea contraction. Baroreceptor maintain aerial pressure at a relatively constant level during changes in body posture and other daily activites.",

STRESS/FATIGUE FRACTUREStress fracture is due to imbalance between load and resistance of bone. It is of 2 types:1. Fatigue Fracture: caused by application of abnormal stress on normal bone.2. Insufficiency Fracture: caused by normal activity on weak bone. Sites of Stress FracturesLower Extremity* March fracture is a stress fatigue fracture of second metatarsal neck > 3rd metatarsal neck.* The most common site is metatarsal neck followed by tibia (proximal third in children, middle third in athlete and lower third in elderly).* Tibia stress fracture = Shin splints* Femoral neck (inferomedial compression side in young and superior tension side in older patients).* Rarely fibula lower end (runners fracture). Upper Extremity* Olecranon is most common site of upper limb stress fractures. Pelvis and SpinePars inter aicularis of 5th lumbar veebral (causing spondylolysis) is commonest in spine. Clinical Presentation* Load related pain often bilateral* The hallmark physical finding is tenderness with palpation and stress. InvestigationMRI provide excellent sensitivity and superior specificity compared to bone scan in differentiating from infections or tumors.Bone scan is preferable for bilateral cases due to feasibility, also bilateral cases go in our of stress fracture as compared to Infection or tumor and also can scan the whole body.* Treatment is symptomatic with cast and cessation of activity.",

In case of cord-compression/prolapse patient should not be allowed to rest in supine position as it will lead to more pressure on the cord. In cord prolapse the patient is allowed to rest in exaggerated elevated Sims position with a pillow under the hip.\nManagement of Non-reassuring fetal status (Fetal Distress)\n\nLateral positioning avoids compression of vena cava and aorta by the gravid uterus. This increases cardiac output and uteroplacental perfusion.\nOxygen is administered to the mother with mask to improve fetal SaO2.\nCorrection of dehydration by IV fluids (crystalloids) improves intravascular volume and uterine perfusion.\nCorrection of maternal hypotension (following epidural analgesia) with immediate infusion of 1 litre of Crystalloid (Ringer\u2019s solution).\nStoppage of oxytocin to improve fetal oxygenation. Fetal hypoxia may be due to strong and sustained uterine contractions. With reassuring FHR and in absence of fetal acidemia, oxytocin may be restarted.\nTocolytic (Injection terbutaline 0.25 mg S.C.) is given when uterus is hypertonic and there is nonreassuring FHR.\nAmnioinfusion is the process to increase the intrauterine fluid volume with warm normal saline (500 ml). Indications are:\n\n\u2013 Oligohydramnios and cord compression\n\u2013 To dilute or to wash out meconium\n\u2013 To improve variable or prolonged decelerations.\nAdvantages : Reduces cord compression, meconium aspiration, and improves Apgar score.",

Patients showing this symptom may experience a loss of equilibrium, a feeling of motion sickness or even actual nausea, triggered by normal everyday sounds.* Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP): In SSCD, loud tones evoke a sho-latency relaxation potential in the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle. Patients with SSCD typically have a lower-than-normal threshold for the VEMP response, and the amplitude of the VEMP waveform in an SSCD ear is greater for comparable stimulus intensities than in an ear without dehiscence. The VEMP test plays an impoant role in the evaluation of patients with suspected SSCD* Low-frequency conductive hearing loss is present in many patients with SCDS and is explained by the dehiscence acting as a \"third window phenomenon\"",

The term prion was coined by Prusiner for proteinaceous infectious particles.\u00a0\nUnlike conventional viruses, the prions apparently have no virion structure or genomes and evoke no immune response in the infected host. These are extremely resistant to inactivation by heat, disinfectants, and radiation.\nThe prions are causative agents of slow viral infections, such as subacute spongiform encephalopathy. After long incubation period of years, they produce a progressive disease that causes damage to the central nervous system, leading to subacute spongiform encephalopathy.\u00a0\nThey are readily inactivated by autoclave at 121oC and resistant to antiseptics and disinfectants.\n\nParija SC.

Many patients presents with recurrent hypoglycemia or severe infections.\nIn the neonatal period, frequent presenting signs include - feeding problems, failure to thrive, regurgitation and hypoglycemia manifesting as seizures.",

Blood vessel radius, 2. Vasodilatation/vasoconstriction.* Thus ultimately, if parameter values remain constant, - Resistance to blood flow is inversely propoional to the 4th power of radius.",

Genotyping and other tests such as measurement of nasal membrane potential difference, pancreatic function should be done if there is high clinical suspicion of cystic fibrosis.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Nasal potential difference\n\nMeasurement of nasal transepithelial potential difference in vivo can be useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.\nIndividuals with cystic fibrosis demonstrate a significantly more negative baseline nasal potential difference, with the topical application of amiloride there is loss of this potential difference.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 Genetic analysis\n\nCystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder.\nIt is caused due to defect in CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein.\nCystic fibrosis is associated with large number of mutations.\nMore than 1500 CFTR polymorphisms are associated with cystic fibrosis syndrome.\nThe most prevalent mutation of CFTR is the deletion of single phenylalanine residue at amino acid A508.\nThis mutation is responsible for high incidence of cystic fibrosis in northern European populations.\nApproximately 50% of individuals with CF who are of northern European ancestry are homozygous for A508 and >70% carry at least one A508 gene. The remainder of patients has an extensive array of mutation, none of which has prevalance of more than several percent.\nTesting for cystic fibrosis mutation was not possible because of the large no. of mutations associated with the disease.\nNow days commercial laboratories test for 30-80 of the most common CFTR mutations.\nThis testing identifies >90% individuals who carry 2CF mutations.\nNo where it is mentioned in the texts that testing only for A508 is enough for diagnosis.

            "Explanation": "Evidence of antecedent group 'A' streptococcal infection \n\nPositive throat cultures or rapid streptococcal antigen tests for group A streptococcoci are less reliable for antecedent infection capable of producing rheumatic fever because they do not distinguish between recent infection and chronic pharyngeal carriage (as many people are carrier of this bacteria).\nAntibody tests are the most reliable laboratory evidence of antecedent streptococcal infection capable of producing\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 g acute rheumatic fever. The onset of clinical manifestations of acute rheumatic fever coincides with the peak of the streptococcal antibody response.\nThe antibodies used commonly for serological tests are antistreptolysin 0 (ASO), antideoxyribonuclease (Anti-DNAse) and antihyaluronidase.\nASO titre is well standardized and therefore is most widely used test. It has following features.\n\n\nElevated in 80% of patients with acute rheumatic fever (So, 20% patients do not show elevated titre) Sensitivity is 80%.\nIt is elevated in 20% of normal individuals perticularly in healthy school children of elementary school age (20% false positive).\nASO titers of at least 333 Todd units in children and 250 Todd units in adults are considered elevated.\nIt is included in minor criteria of jones criteria (not in major criteria).\n\n\nAnti DNAse B titers of 240 Todd units or greater in children and 1200 Todd units or greater in adults are considered elevated.\nIf three antibody tests (ASO, anti-DNAse and anti-hyaluronidase) are used simultaneously, a titer for at least one antibody test is elevated in 95% of cases \u2014> Sensitivity of combined three antibody tests is 95%.\nThe streptozyme test is a simple slide agglutination test for extra-cellular streptococcal antigen absorbed to red blood cells (passive hemagglutination) test. It is almost 100% sensitive but specificity is very low and it is less standardized and less reproducible than the other antibody tests. Therefore, it should not be used as a diagnostic test for evidence of antecedent group A streptococcal infection.\n\nAbout option 'b'\n\nASO titre may not be elevated in PSGN if PSGN develops secondary to skin infection.",

            "Explanation": "Aneuploidy\n\nEach human cell consists of 23 pair of chromosomes i.e., the normal chromosome number is 46\nAneuploidy is a deviation from the normal number of 46 chromosome. Which could be be 47 or 45 chromosomes or it can be defined as state of having chromosome number that is not multiple of 23.\n\nNondisjunction\n\nNondisjunction is failure of paired homologus chromosomes to separate during the first meiotic division that leads to the production of gametes (ova and spermatozoa).\nThus, some gametes receive two and other receive none of the involved pair. After the second meiotic division the resulting gametes will have 24 and 22 chromosomes respectively. Such gametes are aneuploid.\n\nAnaphase lag\n\nIn anaphase lag, one homologus chromosome in meiosis or one chromatid in mitosis lags behind and is left out of the cell nucleus. This results in one normal cell and one cell with monosomy.\n\nSurvival of Aneuploidy\n\nMonosomy or trisomy involving the sex chromosome are compatible with life and are usually associated with variable degree of phenotypic abnormalities.\nMonosomy involving an autosome generally represents loss of too much genetic information to permit live births or\u00a0 even embryogenesis.\nWith the exception of trisomy 21 all others will produce severely handicapped infants who almost invariably die at an early age.\n\nEstimated abortion rate in early pregnancy",

The fetal prognosis for women with chronic renal disease is favorable as long as they do not develop superimposed preeclampsia.\nSecond to hypertension, the most valuable prognostic index for patients with chronic renal disease during pregnancy is the degree of renal function impairment:\n\n\u2013 In patients with normal or only midly impaired renal function, pregnancy does not accelerate renal damage\n\u2013 In patients with moderate renal insufficiency (serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL or greater before pregnancy or creatinine clearance <30 ml/min. there is a decline in renal function during pregnancy).\n\nAnother important prognostic sign is the presence or absence of proteinuria. As a general rule, if the patient has 2+ or more protein in qualitative tests or 3 g or more in 24 hours urine collections at the beginning of pregnancy, the tendency will be toward increased protein losses and development of nephritic syndrome during pregnancy.\nThe histologic characteristics of the renal lesion also have prognostic value.",

Impoant points about CLL: CLL is the most common leukemia of adults in the Western world. CLL is the cancer which is associated with presence of Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia. CLL is the cancer which is not associated with Radiation exposure. CLL patient blood sample contains large numbers of small round lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm. Some of these cells are usually disrupted in the process of making smears, producing so-called Smudge cells. These patients are best identified with the help of Tumor cells exhibiting specific type of CD markers paicularly -CD19, CD20, CD23, CD5.",

Tracheal suctioning is best done by applying suction directly to the endotracheal tube.\n\n\nAfter providing initial steps, the further management is same as with resucitation for other conditions.",

            "Explanation": "Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome and Delirium Tremens Alcohol withdrawal syndrome typically occurs within 1-2 days of alcohol abstinence and is characterized by autonomic hyperactivity, tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, transient hallucinations, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, and tonic-clonic seizures. Symptoms may be mild for many patients, but if left untreated, it can lead to delirium tremens, an uncommon but severe and life-threatening manifestation of withdrawal marked by severe hallucinations, disorientation, and autonomic overactivity. Symptoms and signs include the following: Profoundly delirious state associated with tremulousness and agitation. Excessive motor activity (most notable as a tremor that affects the face, tongue, and extremities but that may also involve speech) and purposeless activity such as picking at the bedclothes. Hallucinations, classically visual rather than auditory, are a prominent feature. Autonomic nervous system hyperactivity: tachycardia, dilated pupils, fever, and hyperhidrosis. Loss of orientation as to time and place. Such patients are often oblivious to the most obvious features of the surrounding environment. Treatment Note temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and record results twice hourly to monitor for hyperpyrexia and hypotension. Consider lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis if fever or meningismus is present. 1. FLUIDS Fluid requirements on the first day of treatment may be as if profound dehydration is present. Intravenous fluid should contain glucose to prevent hypoglycemia. 2. THIAMINE Thiamine, 100 mg/d, prevents Wernicke encephalopathy. 3. BENZODIAZEPINES Benzodiazepines are the primary form of treatment. They may also prevent patients with impending delirium tremens from developing a full-blown case.Drug of choice-Chlordiazepoxide a - Fatty liver- irrelevant b - Its abrupt withdrawal not gradual d - Small doses of alcohol consumption will not lead to raving. Therefore, a,b,d ruled out.",

The imperative here is to come up with an acceptable compromise for the dentition, one that will mask the underlying skeletal deformity as much as possible. This can be achieved using Steiner\u2019s sticks, which allow calculations to be carried out for a particular ANB value.\nIn addition to commonly used sagittal discrepancy indicators, that is angle ANB, sagittal maxilla mandibular relationship should be reconfirmed with other variables which include WITS appraisal, A\u2013B plane angle and beta angle.\u00a0\nKey Concept:\nTweed\u2019s analysis (originally undertaken in 1954) is primarily based on inclination of the mandibular incisors to the basal bone and the latter\u2019s association with the vertical relation of the mandible to the cranium. Tweed\u2019s analysis is clinically oriented. It does not directly assess the jaws.\n\u00a0\nReference: Orthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities 3rd O P Kharbanda, pdf no 1016,997,981,2463",

            "Explanation": "Biomechanical Considerations\nThe maxilla can be advanced 2-4 mm forward over a period of 8-12 months. The amount of maxillary movement is influenced by a number of factors like:\n\nAmount of force:\u00a0Successful maxillary protraction can be brought about by 300-500 gm of force per side in the primary or mixed dentition.\nDirection of force:\u00a0According to most authors,\u00a0a 15- 20\u00b0 downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.\n\tIn most cases of maxillary deficiency, maxilla is deficient in the vertical plane as well, therefore, a slight downward, direction of force is usually desirable. The line of force passes below the center of resistance of the maxilla producing a counter-clockwise moment on the maxilla and dentition. This results in a possible extrusion of maxillary posterior teeth leading to a downward and backward rotation of the mandible.\n\tHowever, in patients with increased anterior facial height, downward pull is contradicted.\nDuration of force:\u00a0A review of literature shows duration to vary between 3 and 16 months. On an average at least 8-12 months of wear is required to produce the desired effect.\nFrequency of use:\u00a012-14 hrs/day.\n\nKey Concept:\nAccording to most authors, a\u00a015- 20\u00b0 downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.\nReference: Textbook of orthodontics 2nd ed Gurkeerat Singh page no 502",

Management follows a sequence of steps together called as Shoulder Dystocia Drill.\nFirst line measures:\n\nImmediately after recognition of shoulder dystocia extra help should be called, in the form of midwifery assistance, an obstetrician, a paediatric resuscitation team and an anaesthetist.\nMaternal pushing should be discouraged, as this may lead to further impaction of the shoulder, thereby exacerbating the situation.\nLiberal episiotomy should be given to provide more space posteriorly.\nFundal pressure should not be employed. As it is associated with an unacceptably high neonatal complication rate and may result in uterine rupture.\nModerate suprapubic pressure can be applied by the assistant.\nMcRoberts\u2019 manoeuvre is the single most effective intervention and should the first maneouvre to be performed. The\nMcRobert\u2019s manoeuvre is flexion and abduction of the maternal hips, positioning the maternal thighs on her abdomen.\n\nSecond line measures: They should be done only, if first line measures fail:\n\nWood\u2019s manoeuvre: It is progressively rotating the posterior shoulder by 180\u00b0. So that the impacted anterior shoulder is released.\n\nThird line measures\u2014They should be done only, if second line measures fail:\n\nCleidotomy: Fracturing the clavicle bone of the fetus\nSymphiostomy: Dividing the pubic symphysis of the mother\nZavanelli manoeuvre: Replacing the head of the baby back into the pelvis followed by cesarean section.",
